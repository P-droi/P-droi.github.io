Hello!
My name is Phillip Entin and I am a PhD candidate at USI Lugano in Switzerland. 
I was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, where I also earned my bachelor's degree in business informatics at [RheinMain University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.hs-rm.de/), as a dual student in collaboration with the German railways. There I wrote my bachelor's thesis on the integration of IT systems into the BPMN metamodel and how to visualize them.
After that I earned my master's degree in [software engineering in Augsburg and Munich](https://elite-se.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/), where I wrote my master's thesis on the automated translation of COBOL code using LLMs, symbolic execution and delta debugging.
And now I am happy to continue software engineering research in Lugano, at the [REVEAL Lab](https://reveal.si.usi.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Michele Lanza](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/lanza/)!

I speak German, English (B2), French (B1.2) and I am diving into Italian right now!
