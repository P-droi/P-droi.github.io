The course "Object-Oriented Software Development" focuses on practical and theoretical aspects of object-oriented software development using Java. It introduces fundamental programming constructs (data types, control structures, recursion, arrays) and progresses into object-oriented concepts such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation. Students also work with error handling, graphical user interfaces (Swing), and more advanced features like generics and container classes
